As every morning, John woke up and got ready to eat his breakfast.
But that morning, SOMETHING'S MISSING  on the breakfast table...

His jar of hazelnut and cacao spread is NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!!

John realises that his hazelnut farm got infested by hazelnut weevil over night, they stole his jar of hazelnut spread, and they stole his stock of (eco-friendly) pesticide!

Damned hazelnut weevil! \"Le balanin des noisettes\" John remembers the voice of his French great grand mother... Going in the attic, John finds the ancestral family weapon against hazelnut weevil: the mighty OREGANO gun!

John is now ready to claim his field and his jar of hazelnut spread back!"
